# Dynatrace AWS Log Forwarder

<div align="center">

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Deprecation and end of support for AWS log forwarder**

</div>

**Dear users and contributors,**

The Dynatrace AWS log forwarder has been replaced with [Stream logs via Amazon Data Firehose](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/shortlink/lma-stream-logs-with-firehose). The new solution allows ingesting cloud logs directly without any additional infrastructure and with increased throughput.

**The end of support is planned on Dec 31, 2024**

## Overview
See the [official project documentation](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/aws-log-fwd) for overview and user's manual. This readme contains only additional technical details.

### Architecture

CloudWatch Log Groups are subscribed to using Subscription Filters. Their target is Kinesis Data Firehose to which logs are streamed. It aggregates them into batches and sends those batches to a Lambda function for processing. The function processes the received logs and forwards them to Dynatrace Logs API. Alternatively, this last step can be done through an existing environment Active Gate.

## Advanced troubleshooting

**Debug EC2 ActiveGate installation**

First, check if ActiveGate is visible in UI (Deployment Status/Active Gates). Right now its label will be EC2's hostname (includes EC2's private IP).

If it is not visible, follow these steps to check AG installation logs:

1. Enable SSH traffic in EC2 Security Group.
2. Connect to EC2 through EC2 Instance Connect in EC2 screen in AWS Console. Use user `ec2-user`. You don't need any SSH keys in this scenario.
3. Check if file `/home/ec2-user/userdata-ag-installation-success` exists. If it does, installation was successful.
4. Check `/var/log/cloud-init-output.log` using sudo. You will find installation script logs there.
